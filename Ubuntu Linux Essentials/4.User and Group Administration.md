## passwd file

the /etc/passwd -----> contains information about all users each line contains ``Username:x(place holder for password):uid(user id):gid(group id):usr home path: user shell``

in linux every program has a user so if there is a data leak through a certain app the hacker only has the login credentials of only this program and not the entire system unlike windows which have one admin account that control everything so if there is a data leak the hacker can take control over the entire system

## shadow file:
the /etc/shadow -----> contains encrypted passwords of all users on the machine
``username:encrypted passwd: last changed:min(duration to change passwd):max(max duration to change to passwd):warn:??:expire:empty for future-use``

## Group file:

the /etc/group file -----> contain information about all groups on system
``groupname:x:gid:comma-seperated``

/etc/gshadow -----> contain encrypted passwd of group if they have one has same file format as group file

## Adding a new user account:
``useradd username``
- the useradd command populates the home directory in /etc/skel
