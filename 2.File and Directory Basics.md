## Navigating Directories:

### Path-names:
- Absolute path
- Relative path
### Common commands:

- **cd** : Navigate using
- **pwd** : print working directory
- **ls** :list files
- **mkdir** : create directories using
- **touch** : create files using 
- **cat** : print file content but command **more** is better for large files
- **df** : display number of free disk blocks and files ``df -h /directory``
- **du** : display disk usage
- **head** : display header of file (number of lines can be specified)
- **tail** : display tail of file (number of lines can be specified)
## File globbing:

when typing commands it is often necessary to issue the same command for more than one file at same time
the use of wildcards or meta-characters allow patter to expand to multiple filenames 

wildcards:
- Asterisk : represent 0 or more characters
		``ls f*`` match files that begin with f
		``ls *3`` match files that end with 3
- question mark (?) : represent an single character 
- square brackets : represent a range of characters for a single character position
		``ls [a-f]*`` lists any files that begins with letters from a to f

## File and directory manipulation:

- **cp** : copying files and directories ``cp options source target``
- **mv** : moving and renaming files and directories ``mv options source target``
- **rm** : remove files
